# Let me analyze the CSS and HTML files to identify the issues

# First, let me examine the services section padding and visibility
services_css_analysis = """
Looking at the Services section:

1. Services Section CSS:
   - .services has padding: var(--space-2xl) 0; 
   - This uses --space-2xl: 64px; which should provide adequate spacing

2. Potential Issues:
   - Navigation might be covering the services section
   - Need to check if proper offset is calculated for fixed navbar
   - Services section might need more top padding due to fixed header

3. Header Gap Issue:
   - The navbar is fixed positioned with top: var(--space-sm) = 16px
   - This creates minimal gap from viewport top
   - Need to increase this value for better visual spacing

4. Brand Name:
   - Looking at the HTML, "Adarsh M" is already preserved in .brand-name
   - The styling maintains the previous dark theme design

   - Increase navbar top position from 16px to larger value
   - Or add margin-top to first section (hero)

3. Services Section Padding:
